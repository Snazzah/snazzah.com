This is my website using Next.js, Tailwind and Preact.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing pages by modifying `.tsx` files in `/pages`. The page auto-updates as you edit files.
